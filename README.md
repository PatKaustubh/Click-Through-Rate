# 📊 Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction Assignment

## 📌 Overview
Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online advertising, enabling marketers to estimate the probability of a user clicking on an ad. This assignment involves building a CTR prediction model using **three classification algorithms** and evaluating their performance.

### 🎯 **Objective**
Predict whether a user will click on an ad or not based on a dataset with **99,999 rows and 27 columns**.

## 🛠️ **Recommended Approach**
### 🔍 **Step 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
- Perform **missing value** and **outlier** treatment.
- Identify categorical variables and apply suitable encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Convert numerical features where necessary.
- Perform feature engineering if needed.

### 📊 **Step 2: Data Splitting**
- Split the dataset into **training and testing sets** (e.g., 80-20 or 70-30 split).

### 🤖 **Step 3: Model Selection**
Choose three classification models from the following:
- **Logistic Regression**: Simple and interpretable model.
- **Random Forest**: Captures non-linearity and handles feature importance well.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost)**: Improves prediction accuracy.
- **Neural Networks**: Works well with large datasets but requires tuning.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

### 📈 **Step 4: Model Evaluation**
Use appropriate metrics to assess model performance:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**
- **Cross-Validation** to ensure robustness

### 🔬 **Step 5: Model Optimization & Feature Selection**
- Apply feature selection techniques to improve model interpretability and reduce complexity.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).

### 📊 **Step 6: Business Impact & Risk Analysis**
- Interpret the best model's evaluation metric.
- Discuss risks associated with adopting the model (e.g., false positives/negatives and their impact on advertising revenue).
- Suggest improvements for real-world deployment.
